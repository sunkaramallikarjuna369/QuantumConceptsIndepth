                    <h3>Step 1: Superposition and Amplitude Addition</h3>
                    <p>
                        Quantum interference arises from the superposition principle: when a quantum system can reach a final state via multiple paths, the probability amplitudes (not probabilities) for each path add together. If ψ₁ and ψ₂ are the amplitudes for two paths, the total amplitude is ψ_total = ψ₁ + ψ₂, and the probability is P = |ψ_total|² = |ψ₁ + ψ₂|². Expanding this gives P = |ψ₁|² + |ψ₂|² + 2Re(ψ₁*ψ₂), where the last term is the interference term. This cross-term can be positive (constructive interference) or negative (destructive interference), depending on the relative phase between ψ₁ and ψ₂. Crucially, probabilities do not add: P ≠ P₁ + P₂. This is the hallmark of quantum mechanics—interference effects have no classical analog. The double-slit experiment is the canonical demonstration: a particle passing through two slits creates an interference pattern, proving it traveled through both slits simultaneously as a wave.

                    <h3>Step 2: Constructive and Destructive Interference</h3>
                    <p>
                        The interference term 2|ψ₁||ψ₂|cos(Δφ) depends on the phase difference Δφ = φ₁ - φ₂. Constructive interference occurs when Δφ = 0, 2π, 4π, ... (phases aligned): the amplitudes add coherently, giving P_max = (|ψ₁| + |ψ₂|)². For equal amplitudes |ψ₁| = |ψ₂| = a, this gives P_max = 4a², four times the single-path probability. Destructive interference occurs when Δφ = π, 3π, 5π, ... (phases opposite): the amplitudes cancel, giving P_min = (|ψ₁| - |ψ₂|)². For equal amplitudes, P_min = 0—complete cancellation, even though both paths are open! This is the "which-path" paradox: if you measure which path the particle took, the interference vanishes, and you get P = P₁ + P₂ (classical addition). Measurement collapses the superposition, destroying coherence. Interference requires indistinguishability—you cannot know which path was taken.

                        Visibility: V = (P_max - P_min)/(P_max + P_min) = 2|ψ₁||ψ₂|/(|ψ₁|² + |ψ₂|²)

                    <h3>Step 3: Double-Slit Experiment and Path Integrals</h3>
                    <p>
                        In the double-slit experiment, a particle (electron, photon, atom, even molecule) passes through two slits separated by distance d and hits a screen at distance L. The path difference between the two slits to a point on the screen at angle θ is Δx = d sin(θ). This introduces a phase difference Δφ = 2πΔx/λ = 2πd sin(θ)/λ, where λ is the de Broglie wavelength. Constructive interference (bright fringes) occurs when d sin(θ) = nλ, and destructive interference (dark fringes) when d sin(θ) = (n+½)λ. The fringe spacing is Δy = λL/d. Remarkably, the pattern persists even when particles are sent one at a time—each particle interferes with itself. Feynman's path integral formulation generalizes this: the amplitude to go from A to B is the sum over all possible paths, each weighted by e^(iS/ℏ), where S is the classical action. Interference arises from summing infinitely many paths.

                    <p>
                        Interference is central to quantum technologies. Interferometers: Mach-Zehnder and Michelson interferometers split and recombine light (or matter waves) to measure phase shifts with extreme precision—used in gravitational wave detection (LIGO), gyroscopes, and quantum sensors. Quantum computing: interference is exploited in quantum algorithms—Grover's search and Shor's factoring use interference to amplify correct answers and cancel wrong ones. Quantum cryptography: BB84 protocol relies on interference between different polarization bases. Atom interferometry: ultra-cold atoms create interference patterns for precision measurements of gravity, acceleration, and fundamental constants. Quantum erasers: delayed-choice experiments show that erasing "which-path" information restores interference, even after detection—demonstrating the role of information in quantum mechanics. Interference is also key to understanding decoherence: environmental interactions destroy phase coherence, causing the transition from quantum to classical behavior.
