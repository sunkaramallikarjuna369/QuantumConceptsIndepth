# Quantum Concepts In Depth

Interactive exploration of quantum physics concepts with structured Input/Process/Output approach for deep understanding.

## Overview

This repository provides in-depth, interactive implementations of quantum physics concepts from the [QuantumConcepts](https://github.com/sunkaramallikarjuna369/QuantumConcepts) repository. Each concept is presented with a structured three-part approach designed to help beginners understand quantum physics through hands-on exploration.

## Structure

Each quantum concept follows the same pattern:

### Input Section
- **Interactive Controls**: Sliders, dropdowns, and number inputs
- **Parameter Adjustment**: Users can modify quantum parameters in real-time
- **Preset States**: Quick access to common quantum states
- **Example**: For Superposition, adjust α and β amplitudes, phases, and normalization

### Process Section
- **Step-by-Step Explanations**: Clear breakdown of the quantum mechanics
- **Mathematical Formulas**: Key equations displayed with context
- **Computational Details**: How inputs are transformed into outputs
- **Example**: Shows normalization, probability calculation, and Bloch sphere mapping

### Output Section
- **Real-Time Visualizations**: Interactive 3D graphics using Three.js
- **Probability Distributions**: Bar charts and numerical displays
- **State Representations**: Visual feedback of quantum states
- **Example**: Animated Bloch sphere and probability bars that update instantly

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)
- No installation required - all concepts run in the browser

### Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sunkaramallikarjuna369/QuantumConceptsIndepth.git
   cd QuantumConceptsIndepth
   ```

2. **Open the main page:**
   - Simply open `index.html` in your web browser
   - Or use a local server:
     ```bash
     python3 -m http.server 8080
     ```
     Then navigate to `http://localhost:8080`

3. **Explore concepts:**
   - Click on any concept card to open its interactive page
   - Adjust input parameters using the controls
   - Watch the visualizations update in real-time
   - Read the process explanations to understand the quantum mechanics

## Example: Superposition Principle

The Superposition concept demonstrates the full Input/Process/Output pattern:

**Input:**
- Sliders for α and β amplitudes (0 to 1)
- Phase controls for both amplitudes (0 to 2π)
- Auto-normalization toggle
- Preset buttons for common states (|0⟩, |1⟩, |+⟩, |−⟩)

**Process:**
- Normalization: Ensures |α|² + |β|² = 1
- Probability calculation: P(0) = |α|², P(1) = |β|²
- Bloch sphere mapping: Converts amplitudes to spherical coordinates
- Complex number handling: Supports phase relationships

**Output:**
- State equation display: |ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩
- Probability bars: Visual representation of measurement outcomes
- 3D Bloch sphere: Interactive visualization of the quantum state
- Real-time updates: All outputs change instantly as inputs are adjusted
